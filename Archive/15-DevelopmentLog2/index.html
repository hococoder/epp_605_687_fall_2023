All steps below are REQUIRED.</li></ul><h3>Screen Views</h3><ul><li>Sketch out designs for the screens your app will display to the user.<ul><li>You can either do this by hand or using a program. If you do them by hand, take a picture so they can be attached to tasks in JIRA</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The screens can include the launch screen, "Settings" and "About" pages, and everything in between.</li><li>For each screen sketch, make a task in JIRA and attach the image</li></ul><h3>Data flow</h3><ul><li>IMPORTANT (people have missed this in the past): In a separate task, define how data flows between the screens in your task. Be sure to include items like archived objects, Core Data stores, and plists. Attach a diagram to the task to show the data flow</li><li>Again, be as exhaustive as possible in your screen and data definitions so you have plenty of items to choose from when it comes to defining your Final Project tasks in the next log.</li></ul><h3>Note</h3><p>Performing these steps NOW will make the development of you app a lot easier later. I <strong>cannot</strong> stress this enough.</p><h2>Submission Requirements</h2><p>You have 2 WEEKS to finish this assignment. This is so you can learn about persistence in Week 3, which you can use in describing the data flow..</p><p>There is really nothing to "submit" - just make sure your requirements are in place by the due date (Sunday of WEEK 3). NOTE: I can see the date and time that tickets were made, so I'll know if it's late!</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../14-ProgrammingAssignment2/index.html">Programming Assignment 2</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week03/00-Week03Overview/index.html">Week 3 Overview</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 16, 2023 at 2:38 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>
