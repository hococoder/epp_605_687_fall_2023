Please download the starter project from the following link to get started:</p><center><p style="float: center" class="download"><A HREF="http://159.203.191.136/S2022/HW1StarterDownload012322.zip">Downlink Homework 1 Materials (link will be active start of week 1)</A></p></center><p>This starter project starts where the lecture project left off, so you've already got that code in place.<br><br>Don't forget to change the Bundle Identifier (as described in the syllabus), and then rename your project to LASTNAME_Homework1. You can do this by:</p><ul><li>Select the project file (the top level file) in project navigator and rename the project</li><li>Xcode will prompt to rename targets and other metafiles as well - select all of them</li><li>Change the bundle identifier (as described in the syllabus)</li><li>Change the scheme name (Select scheme drop down, select "Manage Schemes" and rename the scheme from the list of schemes)</li><li>Rename the top-level directory (the one that contains the .xcodeproj file)</li></ul><h2>Assignment Requirements</h2><p>To build on the project, you should do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a Swift Playground to test out some code before putting it in your project:</strong><ul><li>In Playgrounds/HW1ConfirmationPlayground.playground file, do the following:</li><li>Copy over the structs that we went over in the lecture</li><li>Expand the "carrot" next to the Playground name in the file inspector, and copy the JSON files in the resources folder into the Playground's resource folder</li><li>Make the Student struct, which should have the following properties:<ul><li>The name, address, email, jhed, imageName as <code>String</code>s.</li><li>A property for the program to which the student belongs (like "Computer Science" or "Engineering"), but NOT as a <code>String</code> - how might you define this?)</li><li>An array of <code>AssignmentGrade</code>s (we defined that struct in the lecture)</li><li>An <code>averageGrade</code> for the student. This property <strong>should be a computed property</strong> that derives its value from the assignment grades. As part of the exercise, place this computed property in an extension of the Student struct. HINT: You can use functional programming to help compute the average grade!</li></ul></li><li>Add the student to the <code>ClassAssignmentsModel</code> struct already defined in the lecture</li><li>Make a struct that populates data structures from the 4 JSON files located in the Resources folder of the project (a stub for this was made in the lecture video), and use that struct to populate your <code>ClassAssignmentModel</code>. This step will demonstrated your ability to read and process JSON files (see the <code>JSONDecoder</code> class for some help!). Generics can be used here to make your job easier!</li><li>Be sure to handle error cases when doing things like reading in from the JSON files (see "Error Handling" in <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/">Apple's Swift Programming Language Guide</a> and the "Handling Errors" module for a refresher)</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><strong>When you have confirmed that the playground runs as intended, you're ready to copy the new code you wrote back over to the main application</strong><ul><li>Make a file for the <code>Student</code> struct and copy the code from the playground over to that file</li><li>Update the <code>ClassAssignmentsModel</code> struct from the changes you made in the playground</li></ul></li></ul><p>NOTE: You won't be running anything in the simulator this week; however, the playground should run (be able to load the JSON files, and demonstrate the data structures are populated correctly) and the correct code should be in the project; this will get you setup for next week when you will make UI views and use the simulator.</p><h2>Assignment Submission</h2><ul><li>Zip up the Xcode project folder. This should be the folder that has the .xcodeproj file inside it.</li><li>Rename the zip to LastName_Homework#.zip</li><li>Upload the zip to the Programming Assignment 1 areas on Blackboard BEFORE 11:59 PM ET on the day it is due (Sunday of Week 1).</li><li>Be sure to test your app before submitting, so you know it works as intended!</li></ul><h2>Assignment Rubrics</h2><p>In addition to the normal grading criteria stated in the syllabus, you will be graded on:</p><ul><li>Use the playground to test your implementation before using it in the project</li><li>Proper implementation of the Student struct, including<ul><li>The averageGrade computed property</li><li>Implementation of the Program property</li><li>Implementation of the array of assignment grades</li><li>Other specified properties</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Proper implementation of the data structure populated by JSON files</li><li>Addition of the student to the existing ClassAssignmentsModel struct</li></ul><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../15-BuildingTheModel/index.html">Building the Module</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../17-DevelopmentLog1/index.html" class="nextModule">Development Log 1</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated August 25, 2023 at 7:13 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
