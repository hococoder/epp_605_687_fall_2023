If you don't see an answer to a question you have, please email me!</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>The final project for the class is designed to do a few things:</p><ol><li>Show your understanding of the principles and techniques we've discussed this semester, and</li><li>Give you a stepping stone towards releasing your own app.</li></ol><p>The 3 development log assignments are designed to help you reach that goal. They are:</p><ul><li>Dev Log 1: Identify requirements - THINK BIG</li><li>Dev Log 2: Sketch out screens and data flow</li><li>Dev Log 3: Settle on a final set of features to implement</li></ul><h2>Important Dates:</h2><ul><li>Dev Log 1 - 1/30/22</li><li>Dev Log 2 - 2/13/22</li><li>Dev Log 3 - 2/20/22</li><li>Meet with me over zoom - Week 8</li><li>Submission of Powerpoint and IPA file so far for peer review - 4/6/22</li><li>Submit Peer Review forms - 4/10/22</li><li>Final project due date - 5/1/22</li><li>Final Presentations and Demos - Week 14 (day TBD)</li></ul><h2>What Should Your Final Project Be?</h2><p>Your final project is going to be something of <em>your</em> making and <em>your</em> design. The only rules I have for the project are:</p><ul><li>It should be worked on <em>throughout</em> the semester - do NOT wait until the last minute!</li><li>It should be an app you could, one day, put on the App Store</li><li>It should <em>NOT</em> be a rehash of the homeworks throughout the semester - you should add your own flair, design, and concept to the app.</li><li>The app should be "functional" at the end of the course - I don't expect a 100% ready to go to the App Store app, but you should have a good start.</li><li>NOTE: If your final project is a series of screens that are barely stuck together and don't do anything, your final project grade will <strong>suffer</strong>. The final project should be able to execute the functionality agreed upon at the end of the Development Log assignments unless you talk to me <strong>early</strong> in the process.</li><li>Did I mention to <strong>NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE</strong>?</li></ul><h2>What if I find out that I bit off more than I can chew? Can I change midstream?</h2><p>This happens! I try to warn against this in my review of the development log, but even then, stuff happens. However, to change your topics mid stream, you must:</p><ul><li>Reach out to me FIRST. We can probably find some shortcuts or alternative methods to accomplish your original goals</li><li>You MUST do this and change BEFORE week 6, and the new requirements must be approved by me before it comes official. Be warned, this will put you at a severe disadvantage - you'll only have about 7 weeks (minimum) to finish.</li></ul><h2>How will the project be graded?</h2><p>The final project will be looked at in a few different ways:</p><ul><li>This series of development logs will (although graded separately) provided a basis for the requirements for the final project</li><li>You will meet with me over Zoom in Week 8 to check on status (that means you should get some work in weeks 4 though 7)</li><li>You will perform peer reviews of each other's final projects in week 10, ~mid-way point in the development. This will give you a chance to get <em>and</em> give feedback. Strive to have a good chunk of your work done by this point!</li><li>I will look at the final submission against the stated requirements, how well things work, whether you properly used the frameworks and concepts used in the course, and grade it accordingly. Again, I don't expect it to be ready to push to the app store, but I will be able to tell:<ul><li>Did you understand the concepts from the class well enough to implement features in your code?</li><li>Did you put the effort into the project?</li><li>If you ran into roadblocks (they probably will happen!) did you reach out to me? This is <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - I can be flexible to a point with the requirements, but if you come to me too late, it will be, well, too late.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Past Successful Final Project Ideas</h2><p>To give you an idea of things that have been successfully carried out over the last several years, here are some high level app descriptions from previous students. Use these to help you scope what you can accomplish in the ~10 weeks you have to work on the project:</p><ul><li>Hide and Seek Game: Using GameKit, Core Location, and other technologies, this app allowed a seeker and hiders to play in a high tech version of Hide and Seek. The hiders could see if the seeker moved while they were counting to 10, and also see how close they were to getting caught.</li><li>News Reader: Hooked into the New York Times feed and displayed both national and local news. Allowed for bookmarks.</li><li>Roku TV remote: Used the Roku API and some networking technologies make an app that emulated a Roku remote (because, no kidding, his dog ate chewed it up)</li><li>Several Coffee Tracking apps over the years, that let you located coffee places around you, take notes on your favorite blends, share with your friends, etc.</li><li>Several shopping apps over the years. Item tracking, locations to buy them from, favorites, prices from online sources, etc.</li><li>Expense tracker - several over the years - track expenses, use camera to record receipts, share expenses, etc</li><li>Pet assistant - uses core location and mapkit to help track your pet's activity, can even support multiple pets for people like dogwalkers</li><li>Recipe App - several recipe apps over the years - recipe tracking, support for video tutorials, materials to shop for</li><li>Household inventory app</li><li>An implementation of the boardgame One Night Ultimate Werewolf</li><li>A Todo/Getting things done, improving on all the other Todo apps out there</li></ul><p>These are just some examples of what you can successfully in a semester. As you can see, some ideas are re-done (a lot), so be creative, and think about what sort of app you would want to make, given the chance!</p><h2>An Important Note: Where does your data come from?</h2><p>In today's world, most mobile apps exist as the client to some back end server that is out there on the internet. It's difficult, but possible, to make an app for a final project that doesn't talk to the internet. I don't expect you to make a server in addition to the client app, so what can you do?</p><p>My advice is this: If there is information you want to fake as coming from a server, set up a class (or series of classes) in your app to provide that information to the rest of your app. This could come from pre-canned files such as JSON files, or a prepopulated database.</p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 16, 2023 at 2:38 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>
