In this development log, you will record the requirements for your final project app. Keep in mind that this list of requirements should be as exhaustive as possible - you will be narrowing the list and presenting that subset as the goal for your final project in a later development log.</p><p>Before that, a few words about the final project itself.</p><h2>What Should Your Final Project Be?</h2><p>Your final project is going to be something of <em>your</em> making and <em>your</em> design. The only rules I have for the project are:</p><ul><li>It should be worked on <em>throughout</em> the semester - do NOT wait until the last minute!</li><li>It should be an app you could, one day, put on the App Store</li><li>It should <em>NOT</em> be a rehash of the homeworks throughout the semester - you should add your own flair, design, and concept to the app.</li><li>The app should be "functional" at the end of the course - I don't expect a 100% ready to go to the App Store app, but you should have a good start.</li><li>NOTE: If your final project is a series of screens that are barely stuck together and don't do anything, your final project grade will <strong>suffer</strong>. The final project should be able to execute the functionality agreed upon at the end of the Development Log assignments unless you talk to me <strong>early</strong> in the process.</li><li>Did I mention to <strong>NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE</strong>?</li></ul><h2>How will the project be graded?</h2><p>The final project will be looked at in a few different ways:</p><ul><li>This series of development logs will (although graded separately) provided a basis for the requirements for the final project</li><li>You will meet with me over Zoom in Week 8 to check on status (that means you should get some work in weeks 4 though 7)</li><li>You will perform peer reviews of each other's final projects in week 10, ~mid-way point in the development. This will give you a chance to get <em>and</em> give feedback. Strive to have a good chunk of your work done by this point!</li><li>I will look at the final submission against the stated requirements, how well things work, whether you properly used the frameworks and concepts used in the course, and grade it accordingly. Again, I don't expect it to be ready to push to the app store, but I will be able to tell:<ul><li>Did you understand the concepts from the class well enough to implement features in your code?</li><li>Did you put the effort into the project?</li><li>If you ran into roadblocks (they probably will happen!) did you reach out to me? This is <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - I can be flexible to a point with the requirements, but if you come to me too late, it will be, well, too late.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Past Successful Final Project Ideas</h2><p>To give you an idea of things that have been successfully carried out over the last several years, here are some high level app descriptions from previous students. Use these to help you scope what you can accomplish in the ~10 weeks you have to work on the project:</p><ul><li>Hide and Seek Game: Using GameKit, Core Location, and other technologies, this app allowed a seeker and hiders to play in a high tech version of Hide and Seek. The hiders could see if the seeker moved while they were counting to 10, and also see how close they were to getting caught.</li><li>News Reader: Hooked into the New York Times feed and displayed both national and local news. Allowed for bookmarks.</li><li>Roku TV remote: Used the Roku API and some networking technologies make an app that emulated a Roku remote (because, no kidding, his dog ate chewed it up)</li><li>Several Coffee Tracking apps over the years, that let you located coffee places around you, take notes on your favorite blends, share with your friends, etc.</li><li>Several shopping apps over the years. Item tracking, locations to buy them from, favorites, prices from online sources, etc.</li><li>Expense tracker - several over the years - track expenses, use camera to record receipts, share expenses, etc</li><li>Pet assistant - uses core location and mapkit to help track your pet's activity, can even support multiple pets for people like dogwalkers</li><li>Recipe App - several recipe apps over the years - recipe tracking, support for video tutorials, materials to shop for</li><li>Household inventory app</li><li>An implementation of the boardgame One Night Ultimate Werewolf</li><li>A Todo/Getting things done, improving on all the other Todo apps out there</li></ul><p>These are just some examples of what you can successfully in a semester. As you can see, some ideas are re-done (a lot), so be creative, and think about what sort of app you would want to make, given the chance!</p><h2>An Important Note: Where does your data come from?</h2><p>In today's world, most mobile apps exist as the client to some back end server that is out there on the internet. It's difficult, but possible, to make an app for a final project that doesn't talk to the internet. I don't expect you to make a server in addition to the client app, so what can you do?</p><p>My advice is this: If there is information you want to fake as coming from a server, set up a class (or series of classes) in your app to provide that information to the rest of your app. This could come from pre-canned files such as JSON files, or a prepopulated database.</p><p>Now with that information in hand, let's talk about Development Log 1.</p><h2>Getting Ready</h2><p>For this assignment, you'll need to make sure that you have access to the class JIRA instance. You should have done this already in "Week 0" but just in case, here are the steps you'll need to take:</p><ul><li>Go to <a href="http://jira.hococoder.com">The Class JIRA Site</a> and sign up for an account using your JHU email address. When that is done, send me an email (<a href="rsteele3@jhu.edu">rsteele3@jhu.edu</a>)</li><li>Once that is done, I'll make a project in JIRA for your final project and assign you and me to that project - I'll let you know when that is complete. I'm part of the project so I can comment on the requirements; remember, no one else is on your team, and all your work should be your own.</li><li>Once there, go to the 605.687 JIRA page by selecting the hamburger menu in the upper left hand corner.</li><li>Go to your project under the "Projects" menu</li><li>Then under open issues, click on Create Issues in the middle of the screen, and in the drop down change the type to "New Feature"</li><li>You're ready to start entering requirements!</li></ul><h2>Requirements</h2><p>To complete the assignment, you should use JIRA to create a set of requirements for the final project you'll be making throughout the semester. If you're familiar with JIRA, you may choose to use higher level "Epic"s as well, but that is not required. The most important advice I can give you is to THINK BIG! You'd be amazed at what you can get done, and if I think it's too much, we'll prune things back in Development Log 3.</p><ul><li>Enter the name for your first requirement. If you want to start with a high level task and have smaller sub tasks under it, you can create sub tasks, work on, and check those off as you finish them.</li><li>In each feature, put in a detailed description (again, use subtasks if you need to break a high level idea down)</li><li>Add as many features as you can think of - you won't be required to implement all of them for the final project - just a subset</li><li>In preparation for figuring out which features you will want to implement in the final project, you can set priorities for each task</li><li>As you work on the task later in the semester, you can leave comments and log time that you spent working</li><li>IMPORTANT: Under the left hand side menu, choose the gear (Project Settings), then select details, and put in a high level description of what your app will be so I can have an idea of what you'll be working on.</li><li>I'll be leaving comments in the tasks to make sure you've defined enough detail to make something meaningful in the final project</li></ul><ul><li>As a guide, your app should feature at least 3 of the following iOS technologies we'll cover this semester (if you would like to use a technology not seen here, please let me know):<ul><li>Threads/GCD/Queues/AsyncAwait (e.g. running heavy processes on background threads to free the UI)</li><li>Gestures</li><li>CoreMotion</li><li>CoreLocation/MapKit (consider this to be "one" technology)</li><li>External packages via Swift Package Manager</li><li>SpriteKit</li><li>Custom Controls</li><li>Animations</li><li>CoreImage</li><li>AVKit</li><li>HealthKit</li><li>ResearchKit</li><li>User Defaults (this must be MORE than what we use for login information in the weekly assignments)</li><li>Core Data/CloudKit</li><li>Networking (with or without a third party package, with or without Combine)</li><li>ARKit (not covered in class)</li><li>CoreML (not covered in class)</li><li>GameKit (not covered in class)<ul></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The following are NOT considered to be technologies you can claim to use, as they are "the basics":<ul><li>Swift</li><li>SwiftUI</li><li>App Icons</li><li>An About Page</li><li>A Launch Screen</li></ul></li></ul><p>For this first development log, you only have to worry about requirements. We'll focus on things like user interface and data flow diagrams in later development logs.</p><p>Here are some tips in getting your requirements in place:</p><ul><li>The requirements should be exactly that - requirements! "The user shall be able to ....", "The database shall contain...."</li><li>Go through each screen that you envision for your app, and think about what requirements may come with that screen. This includes functionality ("The login button shall authenticate with Biometrics using FaceID or TouchID", required data ("the Student struct shall contain the following properties....", data flow ("pages shall reference the data model to retrieve the appropriate data..."), and more</li><li>Stay away from "simple" requirements ("the app shall have an app icon"), or ones that are too high level ("The app shall have a settings page") UNLESS you then create child requirements under it</li></ul><p>An example JIRA project can be accessed from your list of available projects - the gradebook project we're putting together in class.</p><h2>Submission Requirements</h2><p>There is really nothing to "submit" - just make sure your requirements are in place by 11:59 PM ET on the due date (Sunday of Week 1). NOTE: I can see the date and time that tickets were made, so I'll know if it's late!</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../16-ProgrammingAssignment1/index.html">Programming Assignment 1</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week02/00-Week02Overview/index.html">Week 2 Overview</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 23, 2023 at 4:41 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>
