</center><p>A few words about today's world.<br><br>Hi everyone. I wanted to add one more module to week 0 to touch on what I'm sure is on everyone's mind. 2020, 2021, and 2022 have been a doozy, the COVID-19 pandemic just a part of what is a messy whole. Our world in many ways has turned upside down - many of us are working at home, mixing what used to be a separate set of home and work duties, which is increasingly difficult, especially for those of you with families. Some of us are dealing with testing positive for COVID, or hearing that your friends or family have been impacted. In many ways, it stinks.<br><br>However, here we are. You've dedicated yourselves to take this class - any possibly others. I'm here to teach this class to you, and I'm fully committed to making sure you learn everything you were hoping to when you signed up for this course. Even under normal circumstances, I do my best to be flexible in responding to questions, helping people who reach out for help (especially when they can't get past a roadblock), and do my best to give the benefit of the doubt when grading assignments. Under these pandemic conditions, that flexibility will be increased as much I can increase it.</p><p>Here's what I ask of you in return:</p><ul><li>Reach out for help on assignments or understanding topics if there is something that just doesn't connect. Asynchronous teaching is not perfect, and it requires a decent amount of communication between teacher and student</li><li>Use office hours - that's why they are there!</li><li>If you want to reach out and can't make it to office hours, I'm available by email at rsteele3@jhu.edu, and I'll also be sending out an invite to the class Slack channel (update: see below!), so you can DM me there</li><li>Don't feel obligated to provide personal information about your health. You're welcome to talk to me if you wish, but you are definitely not obligated. I know <em>I've</em> had my share of bad days and weeks, it's ok if you have them too. Just keep me posted.</li><li>Having said that however - don't wait until the last minute to get work done (this is something I warn of even in the normal times!). This just makes things more stressful.</li></ul><p>To sum this all up - I'm here to help you learn. Do your best to reach out when things don't make sense. And let's all stay healthy this semester.<br><br>The Slack Channel invite (join the #605-687-Spring-2022 channel): <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hococoder/shared_invite/zt-1f36biwhg-7xX8g0SwM6WdPbnqAxvIgw">Join us on Slack!</a></p><p>Please keep this private and only use it for this class! Thanks!</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../04-ThirdPartyTools/index.html" class="nextModule">Third Party Tools</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week01/00-Week01Overview/index.html" class="nextModule">Week 1 Overview</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated August 25, 2023 at 7:13 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
